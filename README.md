## Why Discordeno?

### Beginner Developers

Don't worry a lot of developers start out coding their first projects as a Discord bot (I did ðŸ˜‰) and it is not so easy to do so. Discordeno is built considering all the issues wit pre-existing libraries, such as discord.js, and issues that I had when I first started out coding bots. 

If you are a beginner developer, please use this official boilerplate: [GitHub](https://github.com/Skillz4Killz/Discordeno-bot-template) but there will be more listed on the website. It is a beautiful website indeed! Check it out!

**Modular commands, arguments, events, inhibitors, monitors, tasks.**

### Advanced Developers

The instructions below are meant for advanced developers!

Starting with Discordeno is very simple, you can start from scratch without any boilerplates/frameworks: Add this snippet of code into a new TypeScript file:

```typescript
import StartBot, { sendMessage, Intents } from "https://x.nest.land/Discordeno@9.0.1/mod.ts";
import config from "./config.ts";

StartBot({
  token: config.token,
  intents: [Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES, Intents.GUILDS],
  eventHandlers: {
    ready: () => {
      console.log('Successfully connected to gateway');
    },
    messageCreate: (message) => {
      if (message.content === "!ping") {
        sendMessage(message.channelID, "Pong");
      }
    },
  },
});
```

Alternatively, you can use boilerplate template repositories that were created by wonderful developers. Review the list on the website, and add any of yours if you make your own.
