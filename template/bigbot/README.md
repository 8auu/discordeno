# Discordeno Big Bot Template

Support: <https://discord.gg/ddeno>

This template is designed for bots that aim or are already in millions of Discord servers. It is written with Node.js as currently Deno & Bun are not ready to run something at such a scale. The general idea of this template can be modified for any other runtime if this improves in the future.

## Improvements

- Change configs.ts file to use an .env file.
