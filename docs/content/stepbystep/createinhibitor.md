Woah! You are almost half way done with understanding all of Discordeno. Amazing isn't it? Something you may have noticed in the last section was there were some options that prevented some commands from running like `dmOnly` or the permission options. we created a setting to prevent the monitor from running in certain channels. What if we wanted to do prevent commands from happening? How would we prevent commands from running?
