Since Deno provides support for Typescript, that also comes into Discordeno. This means you don't need to compile TypeScript before you use it. However, this isn't really why Discordeno is the best library for TypeScript developers. When I developed this library, I was experimenting with a lot of different things and one of them was automated typings.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Whenever I used other libraries, I was always seeing typings being inaccurate or problematic. This is because in any Discord API library, the majority is not used by the library itself so TypeScript doesn't warn the library developers. This makes it extremely likely that those typings become inaccurate or out of date because of simple mistakes like forgetting to update typings. Sometimes libraries will add a property and forget to add that on their typings. This makes it useable for JavaScript developers but not for TypeScript devs. For TypeScript developers, typings is everything! So I asked myself how could I solve this in my own library because I didn't want to have to suffer these problems again. The best solution was to not have any typings for the module at all.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In Discordeno, there are no typings created/maintained manually.

None of the libraries gave much love and attention to Typescript developers the way it deserves. Discord.JS developers continues to make breaking changes(on \\\"stable\\\" version) to TS projects without bumping the MAJOR version causing TS developers to have their bots break. Eris was the most stable when it comes to JS, but in regards to TS, I was personally maintaing the typings and this was just a hassle to try and maintain when very few others cared to keep it properly maintained. Detritus was in fact the best library for TS, but once again it lacked in proper stability. It only had 1 master branch and no signs of a proper stable version where I would not have to worry about breaking changes.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This is why I made it one of my foundational goals of this library to have the best stability for TypeScript developers. No matter how small, a breaking change is a breaking change when it affects the public API. I could care less if we end up at version 500. Being afraid to bump a MAJOR because it's a small change or a typing change is a terrible decision as a library maintainer and destroys the experience for end users.

Whenever I make a small bug fix or new feature that does not break your code it would be released in a new release such as today's release of v4.0.1. This means you have to manually update your code to get these latest improvements. Until you do, you may have bugs or possibly missing features.

Deno makes this possible because it can pull the latest code from any URL even github. So using Github branches to it's peak I create a branch for each version. These versions simply update automatically and you dont have to worry about updating. The only time you need to update is when you bump a MAJOR version like from v4 to v5. Because these may need you to make changes in your code. Note, even the good part about SemVer can be slightly removed by just locking a certain commit as well using this method.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"At the end of the day, I think both systems can work and I am curious how everyone feels about them.
