Let's use the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Invite`}</inlineCode>{` command as our example. When you open the command, you will see something like this:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-ts\"\n      }}>{`import { botCache } from \"../../mod.ts\";\nimport { sendMessage } from \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skillz4Killz/Discordeno/v7/src/handlers/channel.ts\";\nimport { botID } from \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skillz4Killz/Discordeno/v7/src/module/client.ts\";\n\nbotCache.commands.set(\"invite\", {\n  name: \"invite\",\n  execute: function (message) {\n    // Replace the permission number at the end to request the permissions you wish to request.

The first three lines are importing the necessary things from their files so we can use them in this command. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense, most of the time, this will all be done automatically for you if you use a good code editor like Visual Studio Code. We create a command by doing:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-ts\"\n      }}>{`botCache.commands.set('commandname', {\n\n})\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The command name here must be unique. If it is not unique, your commands will not work properly as you wish. For example, you can't have 2 commands with the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`ping`}</inlineCode>{` name. In this case, our command is called `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`invite`}</inlineCode>{`.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`name: 'invite'`}</inlineCode>{` is also written as it is useful for our help command and inhibitors! Normally, these two things will be the same. So far it's super easy right.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Next is the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`execute`}</inlineCode>{`. This is where the magic happens. This is the function that is triggered when the command is ran by a user. In this case, the bot simply sends a message to a channel where the command was ran and sends an invite link. Let's take a minute and optimize this for our case. We don't `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`NEED`}</strong>{` admin permissions for our bot. Let's go to the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#0\"\n      }}>{`permission calculator`}</a>{` and figure out the permissions we need for our bot.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Once you have decided which permissions you want to request, you can copy the number and replace it here. For example, if we want `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`68640`}</inlineCode>{` as our permissions. We can modify our command to be:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-ts\"\n      }}>{`    \\`https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=\\${botID}&scope=bot&permissions=68640\\`,\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Lastly, let's get rid of the comment there as now it is customized to our needs.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Command Descriptions`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Right now, if you were to go to Discord and type `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`!help invite`}</inlineCode>{`, you would see quite a bit of information. But where does all that text come from? It's not in this file. The description option tells Discordeno what to show the user when they use the help command. In that help message, each command has a small description next to it. The magic is happening because of Discordeno's translations feature.`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`Discordeno has built in multi-lingual support. You can support as many languages as you wish. We will learn more about languages when we create our own language but for now we just want to see how to customize the command.

We will see the correct way to do it when we get to translations.`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`Let's add a custom description to our invite command.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-ts\"\n      }}>{`    name: \"invite\",\n    description: \"Like the bot?

What if we wanted this command to also work with other names besides `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`invite`}</inlineCode>{`. For example, as a shortcut what if users could just type `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`!inv`}</inlineCode>{` or as an alias type `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`!join`}</inlineCode>{`. Let's go ahead and set that up. Go to the very last line of invite command file and type in `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`alias`}</inlineCode>{`. You will see a popup showing you an autocompleted version of `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`createCommandAliases`}</inlineCode>{`. Press enter and boom the magic is happening!`}</p>\n    <p>{`The createCommandAliases takes in two arguments. The first argument is always the command name. In this case it is `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`invite`}</inlineCode>{`. The second argument is the aliases you want to provide.

You can add as many aliases as you like. If you see a lot of users typing it wrong by accident you can add those typos as aliases as well.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Let's start testing this out. But first, let's understand something important.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Reloading`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Okay, we need to first understand a core concept of developing discord bots. If you had to restart your bot every time you made a tiny change, it would get really annoying/tedious to do. Also, if you had restarted your bot 1000 times, you would be in big trouble because Discord would ban your bot for 24 hours. The bigger your bot gets, the faster it is to hit this limit of 1000 identify calls to the Discord API.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To solve this issue, Discordeno provides you with a really cool `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`reload`}</inlineCode>{` command. Whenever you make a change to any command, event, monitor, inhibitor, task, language or argument you can simply reload it. You don't need to restart your bot every time.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Now since we added the aliases above, let's test it out.`}</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`!inv`}</inlineCode>{` this will not work`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`!reload commands`}</inlineCode>{` this will reload the files and the aliases will be created.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`!inv`}</inlineCode>{` This will now work. 🎉`}</li>\n    </ol>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <p>{`Perfect! You can take some time and customize the invite command to your needs if you wish. For example, this is my bot's invite command.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"https://i.imgur.com/4WRFMtR.png\",\n        \"alt\": \"image\"\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{`Nice!
